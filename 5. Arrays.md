# Arrays
- The simplest data structure is the array, which is a contiguous block of memory
- Retrieving and updating A[i] takes O(1) time
- The time complexity to delete the element at index i from an array of length n is O(n - i).

## Bootcamp
- Given a list, reorder the elements such that the even numbers appear before the odd numbers in the list.
- Solve this without using additional storage (i.e. space complexity is O(1))

```
def even_odd(A):
    next_even, next_odd = 0, len(A)-1
    while next_even < next_odd:
        if A[next_even] % 2 == 0:
            next_even += 1
        else:
            A[next_even], A[next_odd] = A[next_odd], A[next_even]
            next_odd -= 1
        print(A)

A = [1,2,3,4,5]
even_odd(A)
```

- The additional space complexity is clearly O(1) - a couple of variables that hold indices, and a temporary variable for performing the swap. We do a constant amount of processing per entry, so the time complexity is O(n).

## Array Libraries
- Arrays in Python are provided by the list type. (The tuple type is very similar to the list type, with the constraint that it is immutable.)
- Instantiating a list: [3, 5, 7, 11], [1] + [0] * 10, list(range(100))
- Instantiate a 2D array: [[1 , 2, 4] , [3, 5, 7, 9], [13]]
- Basic operations: len(A), A.append(42), A.remove(2), and A.insert(3,28)
- a in A (O(n) time complexity)
