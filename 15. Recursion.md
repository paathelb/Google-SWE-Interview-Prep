### 1. The Towers of Hanoi Problem
- French mathematician Edouard Lucas invented the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in 1883. 
- Consider a peg that contains rings in sorted order where the lowest contain the largest ring. The goal is to transfer these rings to an initially empty peg. You cannot place a larger ring on top of a smaller ring.

```
NUM_PEGS = 3

def compute_tower_hanoi(num_rings):
    def compute_tower_hanoi_steps(num_rings_to_move, from_peg, to_peg, use_peg):
        if num_rings_to_move > 0:
            compute_tower_hanoi_steps(num_rings_to_move - 1, from_peg, use_peg, to_peg)
            pegs[to_peg].append(pegs[from_peg].pop())
            result.append([from_peg, to_peg])
            compute_tower_hanoi_steps(num_rings_to_move - 1, use_peg, to_peg, from_peg)

    # Initialize pegs.
    result = []
    pegs = [list(reversed(range(1, num_rings + 1)))] + [[] for _ in range(1, NUM_PEGS)]
    print(pegs)
    compute_tower_hanoi_steps(num_rings, 0, 1, 2)
    return result

print(compute_tower_hanoi(3))
```

### 2. Generate all Nonattacking Placements of n-Queens
- A nonattacking placement of queens is one in which no two queens are in the same row column, or diagonal.
- Create a program that returns all distinct nonattacking placements of n queens on an n x n chessboard, where n is an input to the program.

```
def n_queens(n):
    def solve_n_queens(row):
        if row == n:
            # All queens are 1egally placed.
            result.append(list(col_placement))
            return
        for col in range(n):
            # Test if a newly placed queen rill conflict any earlier queens
            # placed before.
            if all(
                abs(c - col) not in (0, row - i)
                for i, c in enumerate(col_placement[:row])):
                    col_placement[row] = col
                    solve_n_queens(row + 1)
                    
    result, col_placement = [] , [0] * n
    solve_n_queens(0)
    return result
    
print(n_queens(5))
```

- No exact form is known for this quantity as a function of n, but it is conjectured to tend to be super-exponential.
